The AI engineer successfully built an AI-powered Personal Blueprint PWA from scratch, transitioning from a mock-data frontend to a fully integrated React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack with Emergent LLM for AI synthesis. Key challenges included debugging frontend rendering issues (e.g., missing imports) and backend AI response parsing. After achieving a fully functional MVP, the project scope expanded significantly to a Superhuman Identity Puzzle app, adding new features like longer tests, an AI chat agent, Google OAuth, palmistry scanning, and advanced meditation features. The current focus is on implementing these new features, specifically setting up the authentication system and components for palmistry.

<product_requirements>
The application, initially an Autonomous Personal Blueprint App, is a Progressive Web App (PWA) allowing users to take various personality/psychology/esoteric tests (MBTI, Enneagram, DiSC, Human Design, Horoscope, Astrocartography, Palmistry) and receive a Unified Ultimate Profile with actionable guidance. It features daily content (horoscope, motivational phrases, micro-routines, guided meditations with AI-generated script/TTS). The architecture prioritizes local-first storage (IndexedDB) with an optional serverless backend for payments/AI proxy. Monetization includes a free tier (2 tests, limited tips) and a Pro tier (unlimited tests, advanced synthesis, PDFs, custom meditations) via Stripe. Emphasis is placed on guardrails, ethical AI (disclaimers, source attribution, confidence levels), and data privacy (local storage, export/delete).

Latest requirements transform the app into a Superhuman Identity Puzzle platform:
- Extend tests by 3x with precise questions for more accurate results.
- Implement an AI agent chat for consultations based on test results.
- Reinforce the puzzle concept: each test adds a piece to a customer's psychological profile for accuracy.
- Create a customer cabinet with Google login, allowing test taking before login but requiring login for results.
- Add superhuman and enlightenment decorative elements for attractiveness.
- Implement palmistry: user scans palm with camera for results.
- Activate 10-15 minute guided meditations (AI voice/sound) after the first test, focused on healing specific life aspects.
- Add short descriptions for each test explaining its goal and contribution to identity.
- Central app idea: collect identity puzzles to become a better version of yourself, superhuman.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Backend API routes are prefixed with .

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Main FastAPI application. It includes new routers for , , and , in addition to , , and . Dependency injection has been refactored across all routes.
- : Defines Pydantic models for database entities and API request/response validation. It has been updated to include models for User authentication, chat messages, and palmistry scan results, alongside existing test and profile models.
- : This directory houses the business logic. New files like , , and  were created to handle the new features. Existing services (, , ) were updated to support new data structures and authentication.
- : Contains FastAPI  instances that define the API endpoints. New routers (, , ) were added to manage authentication, AI chat, and palmistry scan endpoints. Existing routers (, , ) were modified to use proper dependency injection and potentially integrate with authentication.
- : The root React component. It now incorporates a  for authentication context, handles routing, and ensures mobile responsiveness. It integrates the new API service layer.
- : A new file introduced to store the extended and more precise test questions as part of the superhuman update, replacing or augmenting initial mock data.
- : A new component for applying the superhuman and enlightenment decorative elements and animations, enhancing the app's visual appeal.
- : A new reusable component for handling Google OAuth login, integrated into the UI.
- : A new component to encapsulate the UI and logic for the AI chat agent, allowing users to ask questions based on their test results.
- : A new page likely serving as the new landing or dashboard after login, incorporating the superhuman theme and showcasing personalized insights.
-  and : These CSS files were updated to include specific animations and styling related to the new superhuman theme.
- : A protocol file capturing API contracts, mock data replacement strategy, backend implementation details, and frontend-backend integration plan. This was created to streamline development.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation and integration of the machine learning model for palmistry analysis (only the UI flow and camera integration setup is in progress).
- Implementing the specified 10-15 minute AI-guided meditations with healing aspects.
- Integration of Stripe Payment Link for Pro features.
- Adding full PWA capabilities (service worker, install prompts).
- Extending tests by 3x with precise questions across all assessments.

<current_work>
The current work focuses on transforming the application into the Superhuman Identity Puzzle platform, addressing several new requirements simultaneously.

The AI engineer has recently:
1.  **Implemented Superhuman Theme**: Added decorative elements and animations to the frontend, particularly evident in  and  (e.g.,  animation). A  component was created.
2.  **Extended Test Data**: Started updating test content with a new  file, implying the lengthening of tests is in progress.
3.  **Authentication System Setup**:
    *   **Backend**: Created  and  for Google OAuth login. Updated  to include user models. The main  and other existing routers were modified to incorporate authentication dependencies.
    *   **Frontend**: Created  for the login UI.
4.  **AI Chat Agent Setup**:
    *   **Backend**: Created  and  to handle the AI conversation logic based on user test results.
    *   **Frontend**: Created  as the component for the AI chat interface.
5.  **Palmistry Feature Setup**:
    *   **Backend**: Created  and  for handling palm scan data.
    *   **Frontend**: The immediate task being worked on before this summary request was the creation of the  to handle camera input for palm scanning.

The work is actively in progress on setting up these new features, with backend services and routers, and corresponding frontend components, being established. The system is transitioning from its initial AI-powered profile synthesis to a more comprehensive self-discovery platform with added interactive AI elements and user management.
