The AI engineer's work evolved through several distinct phases. Initially, the project was Superhuman Identity Puzzle, focusing on extending tests, implementing AI chat, Google OAuth, palmistry, and guided meditations. The AI successfully implemented the core palmistry feature, integrating Emergent LLM for analysis and building a robust camera component after debugging initial issues. It then added seven new personality tests, a Constellation Puzzle Board dashboard, and a comprehensive scoring system, transitioning from a premium to a free for all model alongside integrating email-based login/signup.

A significant pivot occurred in messages 300-304, where the user requested a complete rebuild to a simpler, linear Palmistry AI application. The AI began scaffolding this, creating new core UI components. However, immediately after, the user provided an even more detailed, comprehensive specification for a Personal Blueprint AI PWA in messages 326 and 329. This latest request superseded all previous product visions, aiming for a local-first, multi-test, AI-powered Operating Manual app. The AI is currently in the initial stages of rebuilding the application based on this detailed Personal Blueprint AI specification, creating the foundational UI components and updating the main application structure.

<product_requirements>
The application is to be a Personal Blueprint AI, a local-first Progressive Web App (PWA). It will ingest user data from various sources: short in-app tests (MBTI-style, Enneagram, DiSC, Schwartz Values), external test results (CliftonStrengths, Big Five), birth data (date, time, city, timezone), palmistry notes/photos, and custom user notes. The AI's core function is to synthesize this input into a single, actionable Operating Manual that provides guidance for work, study, relationships, and daily rituals. Features include guided meditations (with TTS), affirmations, a daily horoscope (labeled entertainment), and an AI Q&A coach. The app prioritizes local storage (IndexedDB/LocalStorage) with no mandatory login. Monetization is via Stripe Payment Links, unlocking premium features locally. Emphasis is placed on transparency (evidence-based vs. esoteric labels), attributions, confidence notes, disclaimers, and a mobile-first, accessible design with English and Polish i18n.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Technologies**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend, existing but new app is local-first), MongoDB (Database, existing but new app is local-first).
- **AI Integration**: Emergent LLM (GPT-4o Vision for palmistry, general LLM for synthesis).
- **PWA Capabilities**: IndexedDB/LocalStorage for local-first storage, Service Worker (planned).
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth (previously implemented), Email/Password (implemented), but new app is no-login by default.
- **Monetization**: Stripe Payment Links.

- : Updated with User authentication, chat messages, palmistry scans, and new  models.
- : Modified to use Emergent LLM (GPT-4o vision) for actual palmistry analysis instead of mock data.
- : Enhanced to include  to handle both existing and new premium tests.
- : New file created for dedicated scoring logic of the new 7 personality tests.
- : , , , , ,  all received fixes for  usage to ensure proper dependency injection.
- : Modified multiple times for routing, initially for Superhuman Identity Puzzle pages, then for Palmistry AI rebuild, and now for Personal Blueprint AI to set up a new global layout with , , and various new pages.
- : Newly created for palm scanning, then significantly refactored to include robust camera permission handling, error messages, loading states, and retry options.
- : New file housing questions and details for the 7 new personality tests.
- : New component for visualizing test completion progress on a dashboard.
- : New page displaying test statistics and the constellation board.
- : Updated multiple times to display new tests, then remove premium restrictions, and now being overhauled as part of the Personal Blueprint AI rebuild to .
- : Rewritten to include email-based login/signup functionality.
- , : Newly created as part of the Personal Blueprint AI rebuild's structural scaffolding.
- , , , , , , , , , : All newly created as part of the current Personal Blueprint AI rebuild phase to establish the new application's core screens.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of all Personal Blueprint AI core screens (Intake Wizard, Tests Hub, Import, Synthesis, Daily, Ask AI, Library, Settings).
- Integration of AI logic (analyze_profile, generate_meditation, generate_affirmations, daily_horoscope, qa_coach).
- Implementing local storage (IndexedDB/LocalStorage) for all user and test data.
- Setting up Stripe Payment Links for premium features.
- Adding PWA capabilities (service worker, offline caching).
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and i18n (Polish/English).
- Client-side PDF export of the Operating Manual.

<current_work>
The immediate work involves a complete rebuild of the application from the ground up, aligning with the newly defined Personal Blueprint AI product specification. This marks a significant shift from the previous Superhuman Identity Puzzle concept. The AI engineer has just started scaffolding the new frontend UI architecture. This includes:
- Updating  to incorporate a new global layout, including  and  components.
- Creating the foundational structural components:  and .
- Creating the main page components for the new user journey:
    -  (the new landing page).
    -  (for image/data input).
    -  (for loading/processing states).
    -  (to display AI-generated insights).
    -  (for premium features/upsell).
    -  (information about the app).
    - , , ,  (for legal and support information).
The frontend has been restarted to load these new components, and the process is currently focused on establishing this new, simplified, and focused application structure as the initial step of the comprehensive rebuild.
